// File path of image
// Times the image has been shown
// Create an algorithm that will randomly generate three unique product images from the images directory and display them side-by-side-by-side in the browser window.
// For each of the three images, increment its property of times it has been shown by one.
// Attach an event listener to the section of the HTML page where the images are going to be displayed.
// Once the users ‘clicks’ a product, generate three new products for the user to pick from.
